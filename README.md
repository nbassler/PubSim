# PubSim
Monte Carlo simulation setups for a range of publications.

This repository purports to collect beam line setups for various publications, in order to recreate the particle spectrum.

Each directory should contain all what is needed to run the simulations using [SHIELD-HIT12A](https://shieldhit.org). Results should be uploaded elsewhere.

Directory structure should be like this:
```
1993_Furusawa/
```
if multiple per year, then suffix the year with a,b,c.
